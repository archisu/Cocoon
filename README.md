# Cocoon: Collaborative Construction for Discrete Assemblies 

This prototype aims to demonstrate the possibilities of information retrieval from a standard IFC model, and the extents to which this information can be utilized for several application areas such as fabrication, planning, and scheduling on construction sites.

The prototype requires only a standard IFC Model as input. An IFC model prepared for a hypothetical single storey residential building is included in this repository, under IFC folder as "basemodel.ifc". Fabrication data generation including the robot motions, does not require any additional input other than this IFC Model. The whole workflow can be divided into two parts: IFC Information Retriveal with Python, and Fabrication Data Generation using Rhino Grasshopper. Further information regarding these parts can be found in the respective folders and in the documentation pdf.

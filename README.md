# Cocoon: Collaborative Construction for Discrete Assemblies 

This prototype aims to demonstrate the possibilities of information retrieval from a standard IFC model, and the extents to which this information can be utilized for planning, optimization and fabrication data generation.

The prototype requires only a standard IFC Model as input. An IFC model prepared for a hypothetical single storey residential building in the scope of Prototyping Project Course WS 2023-24 is included in this repository, under IFC folder as "basemodel.ifc". Fabrication data generation including generation of the robot motions, does not require any additional input.

The prototype can be divided into two individually functional parts: IFC Information Retriveal with Python, and Fabrication Data Generation using Cocoon:Discrete Assemblies Plug-in for Rhino Grasshopper. Further information regarding these parts can be found in the respective folders and in the documentation.
